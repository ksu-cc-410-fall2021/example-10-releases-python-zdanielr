The best of both worlds
Speak of the devil
See eye to eye
Once in a blue moon
When pigs fly
To cost an arm and a leg
A piece of cake
Let the cat out of the bag
To feel under the weather
To kill two birds with one stone
To add insult to injury
You can't judge a book by its cover
To hit the nail on the head
A blessing in disguise
Let someone off the hook
Getting a taste of your own medicine
Giving someone the cold shoulder
That's the last straw
The elephant in the room
Stealing someone's thunder
